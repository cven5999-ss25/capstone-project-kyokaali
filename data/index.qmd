glimpse(uganda_water_data)

dim(uganda_water_data)

# Group by water source type and count the number of records
uganda_water_data |> 
  group_by(water_source) |> 
  summarise(n = n())

#Group by functionality status
uganda_water_data |> 
  group_by(status) |> 
  summarise(count = n(), .groups = "drop") 
```
