## General information


1.  Title of Dataset: Water Point Infrastructure in Uganda (2017–2020)


2.  Descriprion: This dataset contains information on rural water point infrastructure across Uganda, including the type of water technology used, installation year, functionality status, management and financing details, and geolocation. The data was collected to support monitoring, planning, and evaluation of water service delivery, particularly in rural and underserved areas. It provides insights into water point reliability, regional disparities, and infrastructure sustainability—making it highly relevant for WASH (Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene) projects, development planning, and engineering interventions.


3.  Data source: The dataset was accessed from the Water Point Data Exchange (WPDx).

4.  Data Collection methods:  Data was collected by NGOs, governments, and implementing partners through field surveys and routine monitoring. Each water point is geotagged and documented using standard WPDx schema, including infrastructure type, installation year, and observed functionality status. Some entries also include update dates, management structures, and water source details..

5. Variable descriptions: Describe each column/variable in your dataset
source_id – Unique identifier assigned to each water point

country_name – Country where the water point is located (e.g., Uganda)

lat_deg / lon_deg – Geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) of the water point

install_year – Year the water point was installed

status_id – Functionality status (e.g., Functional, Non-functional)

water_source – Type of water source (e.g., borehole, spring, protected well)

water_tech – Water technology used (e.g., hand pump, piped system, rainwater catchment)

management_clean – Management structure responsible for operation and maintenance

pay – Indicates whether users pay to access water

fecal_coliform_presence – Indicates whether fecal contamination testing was conducted and the result (if any)

report_date – Date when the water point was last updated or assessed

source – Name of the contributing organization or data collector
